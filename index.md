## 1. Post Creator
This is the projects I made in 2019 as a test to join [Vkontakte](https://vk.com/) team. This is supposed to be a part of the social media app that would allow user to create custom picture to post on her feed.

You can write and format the text message, select the background and smash some stickers on top. The resulting image can be saved on your device. 
Here is the [repo](https://github.com/Yennefer/PostCreator) of this project. There's nothing interesting in terms of architecture, but it showcases some work with UI.
